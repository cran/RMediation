\description{
Data were obtained from eight replicated experiments. The data were collected on the first day of class as part of the first Dr. MacKinnon's (2018) classroom teaching. The pedagogical value of the experiment was that students would have first-hand knowledge of the experiment thereby increasing their understanding of course concepts. Permission to use the data was obtained from the university Institutional Review Board.
